  ## Description
  A small project about working with data and learning more about the associated technologies.

  ## Installation
  Pip install: pyodbc, random, decouple, datetime, pandas, and smtplib.  Next, create an MS Acess database and make sure to include it in env file.  A good resource to help with smtplib setup is: https://www.alfredosequeida.com/blog/how-to-send-text-messages-for-free-using-python-use-python-to-send-text-messages-via-email/.  You will need to retrieve the providers file in order for this functionality to work.  Finally, run the python files in this order: main.py, pandas_test.py, and finally avg.py.  This should yield a new excel file with the averages of the randomly generated data as well as a text notification including the averages.

  ## Usage
  To be used to practice with data sets and the pandas python library.
